          Data Extraction and Visualization in Power BI
          <p>
            Project description The project aims to showcase a step-by-step
            process of extracting data from an Open API using Python. It
            utilizes the requests library to interact with the API, retrieves
            the required data, and saves it in a structured format, such as JSON
            or CSV. Following the data extraction, the project demonstrates how
            to leverage Power BI for data visualization. Power BI is a powerful
            tool that allows users to connect to various data sources, create
            interactive visualizations, and generate insights from the data.{" "}
